## Configuring the project

If you **clone** the repository, you do not need to run `git init` command.

To add a file to the repository, run the command:

```shell
git add <filename>
```

To commit an added file, run the following command:

```shell
git commit -m "Your Commit Message"
```

To push the file to the remote, run the following command:

```shell

git push

# git push <remote_name> <branch_name>

git push origin main
```

To pull the latest changes, run the following command:

```shell
git pull

# git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
git pull origin main
```
